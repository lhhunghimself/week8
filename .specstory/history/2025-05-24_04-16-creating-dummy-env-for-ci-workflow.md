# Creating Dummy .env for CI Workflow (2025-05-23 21:16:44)

the workflow requires the keys in .env to be given to db service to work. For the test make some dummy keys.

# Adding Environment Variables to GitHub Actions Workflow

You need to provide environment variables to the database service for your CI workflow to work properly. I'll modify the GitHub Actions workflow to create a dummy `.env` file before running the tests.

Here's the edit to your CI workflow file:

```yaml:.github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Testing

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    # Allows manual triggering of the workflow

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
    
    - name: Install Docker Compose
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
        docker-compose --version
    
    - name: Create dummy .env file for testing
      run: |
        cat > .env << EOF
        POSTGRES_USER=testuser
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=testpassword
        POSTGRES_DB=testdb
        POSTGRES_HOST=db
        FLASK_SECRET_KEY=test_secret_key
        EOF
    
    - name: Start services with docker-compose
      run: |
        docker-compose --profile debug up -d
    
    - name: Wait for services to be ready
      run: |
        # Wait for Flask app to become available
        echo "Waiting for Flask app to start..."
        timeout=60
        counter=0
        while ! curl -s http://localhost:80 > /dev/null; do
          if [ $counter -eq $timeout ]; then
            echo "Timed out waiting for Flask app"
            docker-compose logs
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "Still waiting for Flask app to be available... ($counter/$timeout)"
          sleep 2
          counter=$((counter + 2))
        done
        echo "Flask app is available!"
    
    - name: Test connection to Flask
      run: |
        response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:80)
        if [ "$response" -ne 200 ]; then
          echo "Failed to connect to Flask app, got HTTP status $response"
          docker-compose logs
          exit 1
        fi
        echo "Successfully connected to Flask app!"
    
    - name: Clean up
      run: |
        docker-compose --profile debug down
      if: always() 
```

I've added a new step called "Create dummy .env file for testing" that creates a `.env` file with the following dummy environment variables:

1. `POSTGRES_USER`: Database username
2. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database password 
3. `POSTGRES_DB`: Database name
4. `POSTGRES_HOST`: The database host (set to "db" which matches your docker-compose service name)
5. `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: A dummy secret key for Flask

You may need to adjust these variables based on your application's specific requirements. If your application needs additional environment variables, you can add them to the `.env` file in this step.

wait for the db service to become available as well

# Adding Database Availability Check to CI Workflow

I'll add a step to ensure the database service is properly initialized before proceeding with the tests.

```yaml:.github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Testing

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    # Allows manual triggering of the workflow

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
    
    - name: Install Docker Compose
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
        docker-compose --version
    
    - name: Create dummy .env file for testing
      run: |
        cat > .env << EOF
        POSTGRES_USER=testuser
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=testpassword
        POSTGRES_DB=testdb
        POSTGRES_HOST=db
        FLASK_SECRET_KEY=test_secret_key
        EOF
    
    - name: Start services with docker-compose
      run: |
        docker-compose --profile debug up -d
    
    - name: Wait for database to be ready
      run: |
        echo "Waiting for PostgreSQL database to be ready..."
        timeout=60
        counter=0
        while ! docker exec postgres_db pg_isready -U testuser > /dev/null 2>&1; do
          if [ $counter -eq $timeout ]; then
            echo "Timed out waiting for database"
            docker-compose logs db
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "Still waiting for database to be available... ($counter/$timeout)"
          sleep 2
          counter=$((counter + 2))
        done
        echo "PostgreSQL database is available!"
    
    - name: Wait for services to be ready
      run: |
        # Wait for Flask app to become available
        echo "Waiting for Flask app to start..."
        timeout=60
        counter=0
        while ! curl -s http://localhost:80 > /dev/null; do
          if [ $counter -eq $timeout ]; then
            echo "Timed out waiting for Flask app"
            docker-compose logs
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "Still waiting for Flask app to be available... ($counter/$timeout)"
          sleep 2
          counter=$((counter + 2))
        done
        echo "Flask app is available!"
    
    - name: Test connection to Flask
      run: |
        response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:80)
        if [ "$response" -ne 200 ]; then
          echo "Failed to connect to Flask app, got HTTP status $response"
          docker-compose logs
          exit 1
        fi
        echo "Successfully connected to Flask app!"
    
    - name: Clean up
      run: |
        docker-compose --profile debug down
      if: always() 
```

I've added a new step called "Wait for database to be ready" between starting the services and checking the Flask app. This step:

1. Uses `pg_isready` command inside the Postgres container to verify the database is accepting connections
2. Polls the database with a timeout similar to your Flask app check
3. Logs database-specific information if it times out
4. Uses the same credentials specified in the .env file (testuser)

This ensures your CI workflow waits for both critical services (database and web app) to be operational before running tests, which should help prevent flaky test runs.
